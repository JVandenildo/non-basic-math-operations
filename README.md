# About  
  
This project is intended to make non basic math operations (root and log, for instance) using basic math operations and basic programming logic. The main reasons for this are:  

- Improve and exercise basic logic concepts;  
- Get a view on the operations with a computer logic perspective;  

A minor reason for this project is to practice on the languages I start learning. For example, in case of starting learning Ruby or C#.  
Every function must contain at least an input request for the user so that function would work on every scenario.  
  
## List of operations  
  
The list of operations so far is:  

- Power;
- Root;
- Logarithm;
- Least Common Multiple;
- Greatest Common Factor.

## Updates  

I'm considering update this project with others languages, like python and JavaScript.
