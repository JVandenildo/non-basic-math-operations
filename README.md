# About  
  
This project is intended to make non basic math operations (root and log, for instance) using basic math operations (sum, subtraction, multiplication and division) and basic programming logic.  
The main points for this project are:  

- Exercise and improve basic logic concepts;  
- Exercise and improve language syntax;  
- Get a view on the operations with a computer logic perspective.  
  
## List of operations  
  
The list of operations I have intention of make functions, or currently making:  

- Power;  
    Done. But only works with integers.  
- Root;  
    Made it, but only works with exact roots (squared root of 4 or cubic root of 64, for example). And some other results may be wrong.  
- Logarithm;  
    I have no idea how to make it. Just saying.  
- Least Common Multiple;  
    Done. I guess.  
- Greatest Common Factor;  
    Done. I guess.  
- Factorial.  
    Done. I guess.  
- Suggestions?
