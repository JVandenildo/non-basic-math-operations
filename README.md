# About  
  
This project is intended to make non basic math operations (root and log, for instance) using basic math operations (sum, subtraction, multiplication and division) and basic programming logic. The main reasons for this are:  

- Exercise and improve basic logic concepts;  
- Exercise and improve language syntax;  
- Get a view on the operations with a computer logic perspective.  
  
## List of operations  
  
The list of operations I intend to make functions of so far is:  

- Power;
- Root;
- Logarithm;
- Least Common Multiple;
- Greatest Common Factor;
- Factorial.

## Updates to come  

- Common used operations update (squared root and logarithm of base 10, for instance).  
    Since they are common use of these operations, sounds like a nice update to do. A function would receive default parameter in case the user don't specify it.
