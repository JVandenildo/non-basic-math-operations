# About  
  
This project is intended to make non basic math operations (root and log, for instance) using basic math operations and basic programming logic. The main reasons for this are:  

- Exercise and improve basic logic concepts;  
- Exercise and improve language syntax;  
- Get a view on the operations with a computer logic perspective;  
  
## List of operations  
  
The list of operations, I intend to make functions of, so far is:  

- Power;
- Root;
- Logarithm;
- Least Common Multiple;
- Greatest Common Factor;
- Factorial.

## Updates  

- Common used operations update (squared root and logarithm of base 10, for instance).  
    Since they are common use of these operations, sounds like a nice update to do.  
- Take a nap.
